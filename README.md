# 🐍 Python Journey 
Hi i am Melih.Im learning Python(No joke).I try to code everyday.I use Automate The Boring Stuff With Python book and whatever i can find on the net really.This is a 4 to 5 months journey and i intend to learn not only core python but also get good at FastAPI and other libraries.I intend to use Python in automation,cybersecurity,bug bounty hunting and backend tasks.Im teaching myself by the way(As much as i could)but im also open to criticism and mentoring if anyone will really.
After im done with Automate The Boring Stuff book im going to explore other sources and will update.
